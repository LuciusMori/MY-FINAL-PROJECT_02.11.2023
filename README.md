# This is my 'Google, hire me' website, which has one and only one purpose:

- to get hired by **Google**!"

## The rules are:
  - It's a "no-JavaScript-challenge".
  - Both the Google landing page and the YouTube replica are to be recreated as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS.
  - With regard to the YouTube subpage, artistic liberties are allowed in the sense that a subtle color adjustment is possible (I chose the blue-label style), and certain icons generated by YouTube itself may be replaced with others (similar ones).
  - Lastly, both pages should include a special feature that sets them apart from the originals and impressively showcases what I can achieve through the use of CSS.

### The sub/pages:

- You can find a preview of the landing page and every subpage under the **"Desktop"** Reference Images below.
  - In view of the fact that time was slipping away from me (and I had decided to create 3 subpages / 4 in total), I must address the topic of 'responsiveness' after the presentation. Only the Contact subpage is (to a certain extent) responsive. All other pages should be displayed exclusively in desktop mode (and maximized).
  - All images I used can be found in the `assets/images` directory.
  - **Hint**: If the attentive viewer wishes to pay attention to the details, they will notice that I have documented nearly every step, especially in the HTML and CSS files of the absolutely massive YouTube subpage. Not only did I give the overall page structure a clear layout; I paid special attention to the color scheme, utilizing the full potential of the Prettier extension. More details on this in the next subpoint. Additionally, I made sure to comment frequently on what I was thinking with specific approaches and why I chose a particular method (and not another). Furthermore, I intentionally left errors that occupied me for a longer time as comments and explained my thoughts as well as approaches to solutions. 
  - To make it as easy as possible for the viewer or reader to follow the process, I ensured a clear graphical separation between the header and the main area, as well as all major projects within it, such as the vertical sidebar. Therefore, red comment blocks were used to separate main sections; blue blocks were used to label larger subsections, making them easy to locate at any given time; light green lines were used for personal comments directed at any reader, and I used the simple (dark green) comment function to simply comment out lines that I might need later on.

### Tools and websites I used to create all of this:

- The aspect ratio calculator (especially used for all the YT-cards):

- Free profile icons (for the vertical YT sidebar): 
https://www.iconpacks.net
- The favicon generator (for the landing page & YT-subpage):
https://www.favicon.cc/?action=edit_image&file_id=1002907
- The image splitter (to split the landing page's big image into 9 equal pieces):
